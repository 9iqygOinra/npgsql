In this article, we will briefly summarize some of the stories of the prophets as narrated by Ibn Kathir in his famous book Qasas Al Anbiya[^1^]. This book is based on the verses of the Quran that mention the prophets and their stories, as well as the hadiths and the works of other classical scholars. Ibn Kathir arranged the stories in chronological order, starting from Adam and ending with Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
 
## The Story of Adam
 
Adam was the first human being and the first prophet that Allah created. He was created from clay and Allah breathed into him His spirit. Allah taught him the names of everything and made him His vicegerent on earth. Allah also created Hawwa (Eve) from Adam's rib as his wife and companion. Allah allowed them to live in Paradise and enjoy its blessings, but forbade them from eating from a certain tree. However, Iblis (Satan), who was jealous of Adam and refused to prostrate to him, deceived them and made them eat from the forbidden tree. As a result, they were expelled from Paradise and sent to earth. Allah forgave them after they repented, but Iblis became their enemy and vowed to mislead them and their offspring until the Day of Judgment.
 
## The Story of Nuh
 
Nuh was one of the earliest prophets that Allah sent to mankind. He was sent to his people who had deviated from the worship of Allah and started to worship idols. He called them to worship Allah alone and to abandon their idols, but they rejected him and mocked him. He persisted in his call for 950 years, but only a few believed in him. Allah then revealed to him that He would send a great flood that would destroy all the disbelievers. He commanded him to build an ark and to take with him a pair of every kind of animal, as well as his family and his followers. He did so, while his people continued to ridicule him. When the flood came, Nuh boarded the ark with his companions and animals, while his people drowned. The ark sailed on the water until it rested on Mount Judi. Nuh and his companions came out of the ark and thanked Allah for saving them. They became the ancestors of all mankind after them.
 
## The Story of Ibrahim
 
Ibrahim was one of the greatest prophets that Allah sent to mankind. He was born in a land called Babylon, where his people worshipped idols and stars. He realized that these were false gods and searched for the true God. He observed the sun, the moon, and the stars, but found them unworthy of worship. He then turned to Allah alone and submitted to Him. He challenged his people and their king Nimrod to worship Allah alone and to abandon their idols, but they rejected him and tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire. Allah saved him from the fire and made it cool and peaceful for him. He then migrated with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lut to Palestine, where he continued to call people to Allah.
